# Object Search Using Adroit Manipulator Arm
Graduate Independent Project by Sarah Ziselman
Closely following the [Object search by manipulation](https://personalrobotics.cs.washington.edu/publications/dogar2013objsearch.pdf) paper written by Mehmet R. Dogar, Michael C. Koval, Abhijeet Tallavajhula, and Siddhartha S. Srinivasa.

## Summary
The objective of this project is to implement Greedy Search, perception, and manipulation in order to retrieve objects that may not be visible or within reach. This repository contains three packages, each responsible for different aspects of the project:

Packages:
* `scene_setup` - Responsible for setting up the scene based on given dimensions. 
* `manipulator_control` - Responsible for the motion planning and execution of the HDT Adroit Manipulator arm.
* `greedy_search` - Responsible for implementing greedy search and returning an arrangement of objects to be removed from the scene.
